# Power Monitor MK3 PCB

## Outstanding Issues

- [ ] [#1](/../../issues/1) Copper pour sticks out of board edge
- [ ] [#2](/../../issues/2) U2's Pin 5 shorted to GND should be NC
- [ ] [#3](/../../issues/3) Reserved pins being used on JP5, JP6 & JP7
- [ ] Silkscreen is uninformative
- [ ] Power LEDs on all rails is annoying and not very useful after the initial power on test
- [ ] No LED to blink from the ESP?
- [ ] No test points on the mains side (was intentional because GND is 240Vac over there :grimacing:)
- [ ] Add CH340G or equivilent USB to UART with auto GPIO0 & RST for toolless development
